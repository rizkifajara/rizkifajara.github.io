Added:
Hen v2.1.1 By SiSTRo
Internal Hdd Linux Loader
GTA V Lotus Mod Menu By 0x199 version 1.03
NEW Auto-HEN Feature (full details below)

Updated/Fixed:
Fixed an issue with the ReactPSPlus payloads where the kernel time set would not be accurate for certain Timezones.
Updated the ReactPSPlus payloads to now show the Current System & Kernel Clock times when you use or highlight the payloads in the menu.
The Kernel Clock value will automatically update when you use either ReactPSPlus payload.
Fixed an issue where a payload would not automatically reload if it encountered a Memory Error.
Fixed an issue in the GTAV Mod Menus section where a payload would not automatically reload if it encountered a Memory Error.
Updated the loading screen graphics in the GTAV Mod Menus page.
Several other small tweaks to improve performance and stability.


The NEW Auto-HEN Feature:
Auto-Hen can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the 'Auto-Hen:on/off' button at the bottom of the screen.

If you only really use the exploit menu to load HEN or if children use your console, then Auto-HEN is for you!

When Auto-HEN is enabled, it will automatically load just HEN v2.1.1 when you open the menu.

While Auto-HEN is enabled, if you want to use the regular menu just press the X button before HEN loads and it will
stop loading HEN and load the regular exploit menu instead to allow you to use any of the other payloads as usual.

If you are too late in pressing X to cancel, don't worry. 
There is a built in safety feature that will stop HEN automatically loading again if it has been loaded previously.
(This is to stop a kernel panic happening if HEN is loaded too may times in the same session)

If you do not want Auto-Hen to automatically start loading the next time you open the menu, 
just click the 'Auto-Hen:on/off' button at the bottom of the screen to turn it off.
Now the menu will behave in exactly the same way that it always has.
